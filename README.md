## pflow-dapp

This is a fork gno.land that adds custom markdown extentions to gno.land

Try it on Fly.io -> [https://pflow-dapp.fly.dev](https://pflow-dapp.fly.dev)

status: Pre-Alpha

### Motivation

Gno.land uses markdown as a rendering engine, we can extend it to allow more interaction.

This repo extends the pflow.xyz petri-net simulator to access content from gno.land realms.
