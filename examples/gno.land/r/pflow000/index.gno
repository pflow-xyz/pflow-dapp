You're not just visiting a site â€” you're entering a living workspace.

Here, models are the code.
Petri nets guide logic.
SVGs carry state.
Markdown becomes interaction.

Built on Gno.land, this is a place for thinkers, builders, and modelers.
Whether you're crafting a contract or simulating a system â€”
letâ€™s build the future, one transition at a time.
