## pflow-dapp


This is a fork gno.land web server that adds custom markdown extensions to gno.land

Try it on Fly.io -> [https://pflow-dapp.fly.dev](https://pflow-dapp.fly.dev)

status: Pre-Alpha

### Vision

Build the largest state machine of **any blockchain system in the world.**

### Motivation

Gno.land uses markdown as a rendering engine, we can extend it to allow more interaction.
This repo extends the pflow.xyz petri-net simulator to access content from gno.land realms.

By decomposing larger systems into smaller models, we can make it easier to reason about the system as a whole.

Though overall complexity of a system may be high, i.e. code and models can change dynamically,
we can still keep the individual models simple and easy to understand.

### Overview

This dapp provides is a multi-user Web3 View for working with pflow and petrinet models in gno.land
The goal is to allow users to create, share and run petri-net models in a collaborative way.

### Logoverse

As coined by Jae Kwon, the Logoverse is a place where we can build and share our models of the world.

Petri nets model composable concepts in the Logoverse by representing concurrent, modular processes
with explicit state and interaction flow, enabling transparent and verifiable logic composition.
