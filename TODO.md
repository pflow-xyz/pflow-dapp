Composable models for web3

Gno.land is an exceptional platform for building composable models
Lambdas and callbacks are the key to building complex systems

These features along with a built-in markdown UX
Will allow us to build a large state machine to describe the language of web3

WIP
---
- [ ] update SVG output to be properly colorized to indicate active/inactive inhibited txns
- [ ] update to support rendering > 1 petri-net in each page i.e. multiple codefences in a single markdown file
- [ ] READ-only views - play/restart/live buttons only
- [ ] consider adding an animation mode - could use CSS animations to show transitions
 
- [ ] build a set of object factories that compose petri-nets for users
  - [ ] polling / votes
  - [ ] simple wallet transfer
  - [ ] swap contract
